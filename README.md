# Battery Life Calculator

A web-based calculator for estimating battery life in electronic devices based on active and sleep current consumption.

## Features

- **Battery Selection**: Choose from a wide range of primary batteries (CR1220, CR2032, AAA, AA, D, 9V, etc.) or rechargeable chemistries (Li-Ion, Ni-MH, Lead-acid, etc.) with manual capacity input for rechargeables.
- **Temperature Compensation**: Accounts for temperature effects on battery capacity (-20°C to 25°C) with automatic factors for different battery types.
- **Flexible Units**: Input time in microseconds (μs), milliseconds (ms), or seconds (s); current in microamps (μA) or milliamps (mA).
- **Detailed Calculations**: Computes average current consumption, battery life in hours/days/months/years, and displays progress bar.
- **Battery Information**: Shows capacity, voltage, size, max current, discharge rate, shelf life, and description for selected batteries.
- **Multilingual Support**: Interface in English and Russian with easy language switching.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Analytics**: Integrated Google Analytics for usage tracking.
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags and Open Graph support for better search visibility in multiple languages.

## Usage

1. Open `https://serbinov.github.io/battery-calculator/` in a browser.
2. Select battery type or chemistry.
3. Enter capacity (for rechargeables), temperature, active time/current, and sleep time/current.
4. Click "Calculate" to see results.
5. Switch language with the "RU|EN" button in the top-right corner.
