# Battery Life Calculator

A web-based calculator for estimating battery life in electronic devices based on active and sleep current consumption.

## Features

- **Battery Selection**: Choose from a wide range of primary batteries (CR1220, CR2032, AAA, AA, D, 9V, etc.) or rechargeable chemistries (Li-Ion, Ni-MH, Lead-acid, etc.) with manual capacity input for rechargeables.
- **Self-Discharge Compensation**: Automatically shows battery life with and without self-discharge over the calculated lifetime.
- **Flexible Units**: Input time in microseconds (μs), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (min), or hours (h); current in microamps (μA), milliamps (mA), or amps (A).
- **Detailed Calculations**: Computes average current consumption, battery life in seconds/minutes/hours/days/months/years.
- **Battery Information**: Shows capacity, voltage, size, max current, discharge rate, shelf life, and description for selected batteries.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Analytics**: Integrated Google Analytics for usage tracking.
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags and Open Graph support for better search visibility.

## Usage

1. Open `https://serbinov.github.io/battery-calculator/` in a browser.
2. Select battery type or chemistry.
3. Enter capacity (for rechargeables), temperature, active time/current, and sleep time/current.
4. Click "Calculate" to see results with and without self-discharge.
